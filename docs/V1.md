# CP Hours — V1 Decisions Summary

## Purpose
Build a real B2B SaaS Hours app for shift-based companies (5–100 employees) with:
- Simple, fast hour registration
- High trust for admins
- Minimal friction for employees
- Production-ready SaaS (not a demo)

## Core Principles
- Boring but reliable > clever
- Server is source of truth (identity + company scope)
- No cross-company data access
- One step at a time (discuss → agree → implement)

## Scope (V1)
- Employees can submit and edit their own hours while entries are PENDING or REJECTED
- Admins can review, approve, reject, and edit hours
- After admin edit, entry returns to PENDING
- Hour status lifecycle:
  - PENDING (submitted) → APPROVED or REJECTED → PENDING (resubmitted)
- Time data stored as:
  - workDate, fromTime, toTime, breakMinutes
  - net/brut hours computed server-side
- Full audit logging for core actions (hours, employees, projects)

## Roles
- EMPLOYEE
- ADMIN
- OWNER (used when applicable)

## Non-goals (V1)
- No billing or subscriptions
- No advanced timeline drag/stretch input
- No multi-region deployment
- No “fake simplicity” via hidden rules
